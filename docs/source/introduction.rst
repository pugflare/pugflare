Cloudflare's mission is to make the Internet faster, safer and more secure. To that end, they offer a number of performance and security options. Understanding what those options mean, which might be approrpiate for you and your website and what the options are for configuring them for your website can be a bit overwhelming. The goal of this guide is to provide not only an explination of how Cloudflare and it's features work, but also to help you understand how to best configure them for your environment.
